name: Instance search hijack
description: |
  An attacker can create a similarly named or tagged instance which is included in a search and therefore acted upon by some business logic. 

  For example, the attacker creates an instance with the tag "Name:WebService" that runs a modified ssh daemon that collects usernames and passwords. When the administrator attempts to SSH to each "Name:WebService" instance, it includes the attackers instance, thereby exposing the administrator's credentials.

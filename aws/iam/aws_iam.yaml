  - id: OCST-1.3.1
    name: Unprotected access keys
    description: |
      Attacker can gain unauthorised access to resources using unprotected AWS access keys.

      If an AWS user doesn't sufficiently protect their access keys, for example by leaving them on a server, then an attacker could use those keys to gain access to any resources assigned to those keys.

      Because the use of the API access keys is global, the attacker doesn't need to be an account already if the keys are exposed outside of AWS.

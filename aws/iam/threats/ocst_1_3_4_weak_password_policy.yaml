  If an account password policy is not used, or is configured to be weak, then an attacker might be able to guess a user's password.
service: AWS IAM
status: Confirmed
stride:
  - Elevation of privilege
components:
  - IAM User
  - Account Password Policy
mitigations:
  - Use a complex password policy such as having a minimum length and/or requiring specific character types.

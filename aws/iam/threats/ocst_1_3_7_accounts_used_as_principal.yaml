id: OCST-1.3.7
name: Accounts used as principals
description: |
  An attacker with an unprivileged user or role in a trusted (source) account may be able to gain elevated privileges in a trusting (destination) account by assuming a role in the trusting account that uses the trusted account (:root user) as a principal rather than using a specific role or user. This is because using an account as a principal exposes it to all principals in the trusted account.

id: OCST-1.2.1
name: Hiding malicious data within object version history
description: |
  An attacker can hide a malicious file in the version history of a benign object and 
  can later reference that file using the VersionId and a PreSigned URL. This allows them to hide
  their exploits and other tools safely and can then use them when they're needed.

  This is similar to the old trick of stashing files in printers to avoid detection on endpoints.
